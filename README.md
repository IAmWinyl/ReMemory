# ReMemory

This app allows you to upload photos from your camera roll to the app's feed, which is saved
onto a local Documents folder for the application.

<p float="left">
  <img src="/images/img2.png" width="250" />
  <img src="/images/img1.png" width="250" /> 
  <img src="/images/img3.png" width="250" />
</p>

Then, a random time is selected for you in the next 24 hours where it will remind you with a push notification to view the photos you've uploaded.
